CSS Logo
=======

I wanted a quick general-purpose logo creator that would
work for almost any site I wanted to create.
This logo that was inspired by the Summize Logo.

Some nice things about it.
* Colors can be changed to match the site's look and feel.
* Easy to create and customize
* Not very tall, so fits in most places.
* Completely based on HTML/CSS (no image), so no assets needed.

HAML > HTML
========
The logo code is written in HAML and converted to html using
More on HAML [here](http://haml.info/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html).

If you are unfamiliar with HAML, you can directly use the
