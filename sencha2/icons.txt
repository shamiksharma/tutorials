The icons that LuckyWolf19 listed are the ones that are available by default. There are, however, a *ton* more available to the default theme, if you're willing to add them in to a custom stylesheet via SASS. At first, it seems a bit daunting if you've never done it before, but if you're serious about customizing your Sencha theme, this is something you're probably going to be needing to get into anyway.

Here's a good article on how to do that:
